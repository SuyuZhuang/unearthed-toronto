- geology doesn't change quickly, the real value comes from finding news about an increase in claims, company announcements etc.
- that's why we prioritized aggregating news & claims data before any geophysical data

- we focused on things that are viable and can actually be made, and we've proven that it can be made by the current state of the web app


Deployment:
- on the cloud
- easily deploy on your own server with an AMI
--> explain how an "Amazon Machine Image" takes a snapshot of our server's configuration
    and essentially allows you to copy & paste it onto your server so you can enter the new url and click deploy
- "one-click deploy"
